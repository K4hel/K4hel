## Hello!
I guess you're spying my profile 😳

--------------------------------------

I'll talk about me. I'm Kahel, a simple programmer.
I started coding in 2016 in Lua language, and it's still my favourite language, but I learned other languages like **JavaScript**, **Java**, **C#**, **C++**, and **Python (BASIC)**. My goals are to learn all the coding languages I can and learn Portuguese and Japanese. If you're wondering about my age, I'm 100¹⁰⁰ years old.
